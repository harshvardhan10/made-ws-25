## Project Work
# Title: Analysis of the effect of Frequent Flash Floods on Local Housing Prices in the United States of America

# Description: Floods significantly impact housing markets by disrupting economies, displacing populations, and altering property values. This project examines the relationship between flood events and the U.S. Housing Price Index (HPI) over several years. Using flood event data—including frequency, severity, and fatalities—alongside HPI trends at national and regional levels, the study analyzes both immediate and long-term effects of floods on housing prices. It explores regional variations across Census Divisions and employs statistical models to provide insights. The findings offer valuable implications for urban planning, disaster preparedness, and market forecasting, helping policymakers, insurers, and real estate professionals navigate flood-related housing challenges.
