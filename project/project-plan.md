The main aim of the project is to analyze the impact flash floods might have on housing prices. The aim is to compare the housing prices before and after the flash floods with the prices during the period when the flash floods occured. This could be further extended to compare the revenue of local businesses and analyze the effects that the flash floods might have on them. We will thus be able to see the varying impact that flash floods have on different businesses
